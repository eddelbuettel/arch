Title: 'Arrow' R and C Helpers
Version: 0.0.1
Author: Dewey Dunnington, Dirk Eddelbuettel
Maintainer: Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org>
Description: The 'Apache Arrow' project offers a zero-dependency C interface which
 this package uses to create and proces 'Arrow' objects -- without requiring the 
 'arrow' package. This package builds upon a lot of earlier work in package
 'narrow' (formerly also named 'sparrow', 'carrow', 'arrowc') by Dewey.
